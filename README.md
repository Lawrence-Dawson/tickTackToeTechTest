### Tick Tack Toe Tech Test

For this test I was tasked with building a simple Tick Tack Toe app

## Installation

 - Clone down this repository

## How to play

 - Open the index.html file and open the console
 - Write game = new Game;
 - The tick tack toe grid is an array like so  [[1,2,3],
                                                [4,5,6],
                                                [7,8,9]];
 - Enter the number you wish to replace with either an 'X' or 'O' by calling the "choose" function
 e.g. "game.choose('X', 5)"

 - Continue playing, the game will tell you when there's a winner or if it's a draw!

 I hope you enjoy this game, I hope to build an interface for the game at some point in the near future.
