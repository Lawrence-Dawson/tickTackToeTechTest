# Tick Tack Toe Tech Test

For this test I was tasked with building a simple Tick Tack Toe app in any language.

I chose to build the app in Javascript.

## Installation

 - Clone down this repository

## How to play

 - Open the index.html file and open the console
 - Enter "game = new Game;" in the console
 - The tick tack toe game is on a grid (array of arrays) like so: 
 
###[
###[1,2,3],
###[4,5,6],
###[7,8,9]
###]
                                                      
 - Enter the number you wish to replace with either an 'X' or 'O' by calling the "choose" function
 e.g. "game.choose('X', 5)"

 - Continue playing, the game will tell you when there's a winner or if it's a draw!

I hope you enjoy this game, I hope to build an interface for it at some point in the near future.
